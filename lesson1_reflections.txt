In windows,fc is used to compare two files.
Its syntax is fc file1 file2
It shows the lines that are present in the file1 that are missing in file2 and vice versa.
So we can compare the two files only in the portions that they stand a difference.
In this case it was easier to find a typo in few lines of code as compared to
identifying the same in 1000s of lines of code.

It would take care of the fact that i would not have to worry about keeping track of version control manually.
At any point of time i would have a sequence of files in the history rather than manually looking for them.
It would be of great help when multiple people are working on it.

the advantage of manually choosing when to commit in the case of Git is you can
choose to commit whenever you have made a logical change to the code.In one case if One has fixed
typo and fixed a bug in different functions, then ideally there should be two commits.As each commit will have
one single purpose and its easy to diffrentiate.On the other hand, since its manual
  if one chooses to do the above case in one commit.The purpose is lost.On the other hand automatic version
  control might lead to versions which do not add any value.


It helps to concurrently check changes in multiple files at one go.
In case of a webpage html,javascript and css are closely interlinekd.So,
  if one is able to view the changes in multiple files at one go, it would be very useful.
