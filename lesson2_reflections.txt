git init creates a repository with  a .git extension file.
git staus gives the staus of the repository.
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        lesson1_reflections.txt

nothing added to it but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

staging area is a when u add files to repository it is placed in staging area where u can commit.

using the git diff command i can reconfirm the changes between my working directory and staging area.
staging area consists of the most recent commit untill i havent added any files for the next commit.
using git diff --staged i can find the difference between files in staging area and repository.

branching helps in keeping track of additional options that i would be doing as a part of experiment,
so that i can keep the original master intact and create a branch and commit changes
in the branch for those additional options.
