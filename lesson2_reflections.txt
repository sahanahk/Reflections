git staus gives the staus of the repository.

Untracked files:

        lesson1_reflections.txt

nothing added to it but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

staging area is a when u add files to repository it is placed in staging area where u can commit.

using the git diff command i can reconfirm the changes between my working directory and staging area.
staging area consists of the most recent commit untill i havent added any files for the next commit.
using git diff --staged i can find the difference between files in staging area and repository.

branching helps in keeping track of additional options that i would be doing as a part of experiment,
so that i can keep the original master intact and create a branch and commit changes
in the branch for those additional options.

Diagrams help visualize the branches,the master and the concept of reachability.Through diagrams
one can understand whether the commit can be reachable or not.

Pros of automatically merging would be that u dont have to worry about nitty grittys
but since git would not be able to identify which parts of the conflict to retain
and which to discard, it might end up keeping the parts of code which we might not need.
